# Travel App

Final Project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree course. The goal of this project was to create a "travel app" where users can input the name of a city and their departure date and receive information such as an image of the city, weather forecasts etc.

The project was built in Webpack to help with the production process as well as bundling and minifying and uses Express for its server. The server receives and sends data from four API's: Geonames, Pixabay, Weatherbit, and REST Countries.
